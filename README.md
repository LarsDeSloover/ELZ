# ELZ
Repository containing spatial data of the Eerstelijnszones (ELZ) in Flanders.
The files are stored in a .geojson format, per province.
Mind that the municipality of Beveren (which lies in the province of Antwerp), is part of the N-0 Waasland ELZ (which resorts under the province of East-Flanders).

The files uploaded on 25/03/2022 represent the situation of the ELZ in Flanders on 25/03/2022. Due to its finer granularity and higher complexity, the ELZ for the province of Antwerp is still under construction.
